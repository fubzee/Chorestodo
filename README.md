## Description
# What is the app for?
Modernising the Chores Chart you would have in your family home growing up. 
The younger generation have adapted to tech so easily and we wanted to provide an application that they can use right from the tips of their fingers. 
The application provides a Parent user to assign a task to their child. Where a Child user is provided with the finished task option. Each task has a reward assigned to it to keep a track of the childâ€™s achievement.
